## Functional Programming
Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative (telling the computer what you want to do) rather than imperative (telling the computer exactly how to do that), and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast it with object-oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and co-located with methods in objects.

## Why Functional Programming?
1.It’s generally more concise
2.It’s generally more predictable
3.It’s easier to test than object-oriented code

## Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are a big part of functional programming. A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function(s) as a parameter or returns a function.

### Functions and immutable data are the only two things you need to ever deal with in functional programming. 

Functions in functional programming can be passed around as easily as data.You can refer to them from constants and variables, pass them as parameters to other functions, and return them as results from other functions.

We can break any complex problem down into smaller sub-problems, solve them using functions, and finally combine them together to solve the bigger problem.

## Advantages
1. Easier to understand (that is, “expressive”)
2. Easier to reuse
3. Easier to test
4. Easier to maintain
5. Easier to refactor
6. Easier to optimize
7. Easier to reason about
