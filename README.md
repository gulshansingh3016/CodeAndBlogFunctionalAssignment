## Functional Programming
Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative (telling the computer what you want to do) rather than imperative (telling the computer exactly how to do that), and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast it with object-oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and co-located with methods in objects.

## Why Functional Programming?
It’s generally more concise
It’s generally more predictable
It’s easier to test than object-oriented code

## Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are a big part of functional programming. A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function(s) as a parameter or returns a function.
